# Delivery Fee Calculator

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

- This application calculates the delivery price based on what values the user inputs (cart value excluded).
- The user can input cart value, delivery distance, number of items and time for delivery.

## Usage

1. Get the application folder to your local computer in your preferred way (i.e. forking or cloning this project). You could have also downloaded it if the project folder was shared with you.

2. Open the folder in your chosen code editor and navigate to the folder via CLI

```shell
> cd FOLDER_PATH
```

3. Since the node_modules folder is ignored or missing from the project folder, you have to install node_modules

```shell
> npm install
```

4. To run the application in your browser, on `localhost:3000`, type the following command

```shell
> npm start
```
